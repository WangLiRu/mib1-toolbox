## What can I do with this?
Customize your MIB1HIGH unit graphics, dump stuff.

## Why doesn't it install?
- Make sure you have an MIB1 High.

## Can this remove component protection?
- Removing component protection is not legal. You can probably modify this tool to remove component protection in some way. But that's like eating soup with a fork: it's not the intented use and I do not agree with it.

## Can this give me more FECs?
- Probably, but then you still need to find a way to sign them.

## Can this enable Android Auto / CarPlay / Performance Monitor?
- No. That's an MIB2 feature, MIB1 hardware and software are limited so you cannot do this.

## Why do I get a variant-conflict error?
- This happens when you tried installing it on a non MIB1-HIGH system. It will **not** work on MIB2 or MIB1 Standard units. Discover Media / Compostion Media are not MIB1 HIGH!

## Why do I get a "script not foud" error?
This can happen because of 2 reasons:
- The most common mistake: You didn't press the "Get new scripts and files from SD-card (slot1)" button in the green menu. There's a reason why I included descriptive text on most of the screens.  There's a reason for reading the readme. Please read them, because it's very risky to do stuff just blindly. When something goes wrong, you only got yourself to blame.
- Your firmware is different from what was expected.. This can because of modifications by parties like APG or because VAG made changes in some way. But.. to be sure this is all not the case, press the "Get new scripts and files from SD-card (slot1)" button.

## When will you make a toolbox for MIB1 Standard?
- Never. I don't have any access to a Discover Media or Composition Media to try and develop/test a solution. The MIB1High toolbox is the result of a lot of research about MIB1 vulnerabilities and possibilities, I am completely in the dark when it comes to Discover/Composition Media units.
